Honestly, I think reading the textbook is the more efficient way to learn the materials since her lectures are poorly organized. She spends a lot of time explaining linguistics concepts but not enough time on math and algorithms. This is very troublesome if you have a big project team (3-4 people), because you will be expected to implement logistic regression, MEMM, etc. She does not teach these algorithms that are necessary to finish your project but happily wastes time talking about IBM Watson, which is just an interesting side thing. In sum, her lectures are not informative; the projects have interesting topics but you have to do a lot of self-studying to do them properly and thus they may end up taking too much time.
